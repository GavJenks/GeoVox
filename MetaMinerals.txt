% minerals formed by metamorphic pressures and temperatures.

Sillimanite
kyanite
staurolite
andalusite
garnets
"green clinopyroxene"
serpentine - forms from very mafic igneous rocks + !!!!!WATER!!!!!
peridote? maybe?
talc? maybe?
dunite?
pyroxenite?

^ seems to actually be a short list, most of the "metamorphic facies" are just special named combos of these few things + igneous minerals that survive. And a lot of the differences are also just texture / grain size / etc., not chemistry.

So:
1) DO get a list of igneous minerals and chemical minerals that DO break down
2) otherwise look up the facies for rock types
3) then work backward to determine any changes that likely occurred
4) Apply them IF or to the EXTENT allowed by what is physically available there.

largely, other minerals just change size, like calcite crystals and quartz fuse into larger chunks making marbles and quartzites, but chemically still the same.

also, a bunch of igneous minerals are stable under high pressure, so characteristically form metamorphic rock compositions but were nto formed by metamorphosis

feldspars move toward albite

pyroxenes and olivine change to new things more often? I don't know. Really just want a stability range for each, but SO HARD to find.
