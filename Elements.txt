% <-- This makes a comment line. Empty lines are also ignored.
% Format is [name of element, one word],[atomic mass as integer],
%[percent portion of the primitive MANTLE]
% Percent doesn't have to add up to 100 precisely, just get close.
% You have UP TO EIGHT primary elements, flagged with a 1 parameter at the end.
% You have UP TO SIXTEEN rare elements as well, flagged with a 0 parameter at the end.
% Primary elements participate in mineral and rock chemistry during simulation, affecting erosion, magma, etc. While
% rare elements are tracked in a loose "bag" of elements that can form minerals still, but the elements and minerals do not 
% significantly interact with the world until the end of the simulation, for gems, etc.
% For rares, it's better to choose elements relevant to your final game or use case, such as strategic metals, not
% necessarily elements in order of exact abundance.
