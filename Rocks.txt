% These are used for interpolating advanced properties. For example, I have no idea what
% the coloration overall would be of a 30% hornblende, 15% quartz, 5% mica.... whatever
% rock. But with reference rocks of known mineral combinations, we can form anchor
% points, make an interpolated lookup table, and guess at the in between values.

% The most important advanced property is "what metamorphic pressures do", since that
% effectively acts at the rock level, not the mineral level, like most igneous things.
