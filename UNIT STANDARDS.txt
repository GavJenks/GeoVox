Default "SI" Units in GeoVox

Note: several units are defined vaguely, referencing aspects of goxels. This is because goxels have 
no formal definition in terms of their dimensions, so these units must be interpreted dynamically if you 
ever cared to figure out their exact SI values. For the engine, the contingent definitions are good enough.

Force
	Pressure: 		short	bars
	Force: 			short	amount of force exerted by one bar over the face of a goxel
	Deformation Force: 	short	number of force units where permanent deformation occurs
	Brittleness: 		short	number of force units where snapping occurs 
	Hardness: 		float	Moh's scale

Thermodynamics
	Temperature: 		short	degrees C
	Heat: 			short	Joules * [however many joules will heat one goxel of pure water 1 degree C]
	Specific Heat: 		byte	integers equal to 1/10ths of water (so water = 10, everything else proportional)

Distance: 			short	goxel edge lengths

Concentrations of anything	byte	integer value of 1% increments. Includes minerals, common elements, rare elements, etc.
