Default "SI" Units in GeoVox

Note: several units are defined vaguely, referencing aspects of goxels. This is because goxels have 
no formal definition in terms of their dimensions, so these units must be interpreted dynamically if you 
ever cared to figure out their exact SI values. For the engine, the contingent definitions are good enough.

Forces
	Pressure: 		short	bars
	Force: 			short	amount of force exerted by one bar over the face of a goxel
	Deformation Force: 	short	number of force units where permanent deformation occurs
	Brittleness: 		short	number of force units where snapping occurs 
	Hardness: 		float	Moh's scale

Thermodynamics
	Temperature: 		short	degrees C
	Heat: 			short	1 unit = however many joules will heat one goxel of pure water 1 degree C
	Specific Heat: 		byte	integers equal to 1/10ths of water (so water = 10, everything else proportional)

Distance: 			short	goxel edge lengths
Mass:				float	units of mass equal to one goxel of pure water at sea level
Specific gravity, solids/liq:	byte 	Similar to specific heat, 1/10ths of water's density
Specific gravity, gas:		byte	Same as above but reference material is pure water vapor (modern air becomes 16, xenon 73)
Concen. of mins, elements	byte	integer value of 1% increments.
Concen. of rare elements	2 bits	Scales based on the element's info, always 0,1,2,3 x [some constant]
