In mantle, litho goxel, AND dictionary, could use one thing, like a "rock" is an object that just stores all the info about minerals and junk.
Upside, tidier organization. And one place to put all the redundant methods, ability to do math like averaging rocks easily.
Downside, +12 bytes per litho goxel, minimum, and if rock contains mineral objects, + a completely unacceptable 72!

minerals could still be relocated to that rock object, but should still use the primitive format


mineral substitutions:
most commonly stored as 4 bits mineral GROUP, 5 bits substitution mixture, 7 bits percent this GROUP contributes to whole goxel.
element formula etc. stored only in rock dictionary, including rares. Thus, a solid rock entirely minerals need not have rares int.

define "mineral" as mineral group:
[GroupName],[type # for igneous, metamorphic, more than one, etc.],[# of substitution variants 1-3],
then 1-3 times repeating the following:
[endMember Name],[Melting point short],[Something about density??],[24 numbers for how many atoms of each element including rares]
